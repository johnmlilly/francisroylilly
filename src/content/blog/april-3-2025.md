Francis received several visitors today, most notably several first class Saint relics. We were able to pray over him with them and ask for their intercession.

Our daughter Bella also drew a picture of her and her younger sister Maxine holding Francis in the NICU. This really represents all of the saints in heaven and people on earth who are holding Francis in prayer. We can really feel you all by his side and we are so grateful.

Please also pray for those who are in the hospital who are alone. I’ve walked by several rooms with patients all alone and my heart breaks for them. We are so incredibly blessed and thankful to have such a loving community of family and friends who support us. We want to “pay it forward” by asking for prayers for those who are lonely here.

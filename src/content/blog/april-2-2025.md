Thank you for all the outpouring of love and prayers. Francis has made some small improvements today but has a long road ahead.

His blood pressure dropped earlier and there was concern for internal bleeding. An ultrasound showed bleeding in the intestinal area near the liver. He’s been given blood transfusions but is looking very pale. He has several more seizures but those have calmed down now with some more medication.

I’ve been able to spend some very precious time with him. I prayed today for him and held his hands and feet. He opened his eyes for me several times and is responding to touch very well. Kara has been recovering slowly today after surgery but is going to see him soon.

Please ask especially for Blessed John Licci’s intercession. One story I read of him is that he helped cure a paralyzed man as a baby. I know all things are possible with God. Jesus’ precious blood can heal all wounds and sustain him.

Francis Roy Lilly was born on April 1, 2025 at 2:19 a.m., weighing 6 lbs 10 oz.

There were major complications during his delivery. Francis did not have a heartbeat for the first 18 minutes of his life, but the doctors were able to resuscitate him and get his heart beating. He swallowed a significant amount of meconium during birth and had to be flown to the NICU at Inova Fairfax.

After his delivery, Kara also experienced severe complications. There was heavy bleeding due to the delivery, and she required two units of blood and plasma. A hysterectomy was ultimately performed to save her life.

Francis is in very critical condition at the moment. He has had very little brain activity, which is our greatest concern right now. We will know more about his overall condition in the coming days and hours.

We have been overwhelmed by the amount of support, encouragement, and prayers from friends and family. We are asking for prayers for his healing as well as the intercession of St. Thérèse of Lisieux, her parents St. Zélie and Louis, St. Francis of Assisi (Francis' namesake), Roy Hollis (Kara's dad in heaven) and Blessed John Licci, patron saint of head injuries.

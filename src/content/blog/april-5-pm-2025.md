We were finally able to hold our precious boy today. It was a perfect moment with him as he rested in Kara’s arms. Time truly stood still.

There has still been little to no brain activity and the seizures have continued. The doctors have braced us for the worst.

We still have faith that God can work a miracle. Jesus gave the blind their sight, cured the sick, cast out terrible demons, and raised his best friend from the dead. We know God can do anything.

Please say a prayer for Francis’s MRI tomorrow. We are unsure of the exact time but will try to share it as soon as we find out so we can ask for prayers during that time.

We are grateful to be able to spend these precious moments with our boy. We love him so much and cannot wait for everyone to meet him.
